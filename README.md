# SWOTxt
A command line based SWOT analysis tool.

Still a fairly vague concept in my mind...

## Ideas/Goals/etc.
swotxt -n -- begins 'new SWOT' dialog.  
swotxt -s [message] -- adds strength to default SWOT  
swotxt -w [message] -- adds weakness to default SWOT  
swotxt -o [message] -- adds opportunity to default SWOT  
swotxt -t [message] -- adds threat to default SWOT  

## SWOT Explanation

S-  Strengths
